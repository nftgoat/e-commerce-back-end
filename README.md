# e-commerce-back-end
I am creating the backend of an ecommerce site using node. This is an important project because the tools used here are extremely valuable and useful.
## What I learned from this project
I learned that I am starting to get the hang of using SQL, node, and APIs. These things are some of the slow hurdles that I have had a hard time passing throughout this course. I feel like I am getting a good understanding of these powerful tools which is exciting to me!
